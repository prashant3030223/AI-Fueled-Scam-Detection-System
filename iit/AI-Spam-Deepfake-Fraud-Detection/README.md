## ???? AI-Fueled Scam Detection System

## Overview
This project is on the development of an AI-empowered solution to identify and prevent spam calls, deepfake frauds, and VKYC exploitation in financial services. Through the leveraging of AWS services, the system analyses call metadata, behavioral patterns, and transaction data in real-time to identify suspicious activity. The users are alerted real-time, enhancing trust and security in digital communication systems.

---

## ✨ Features
- ???? **Spam Call Detection**: A transitional audio from a call is transcribed with AWS Transcribe and Fraud Indicators are analyzed from the metadata and transcript.
- ???? **Deep Fake Detection VKYC**: Amazon SageMaker and Rekognition will have facial and voice anomalies that identify a deep fake.
- ???? **Financial Fraud Detection**: Analysis of the transaction data for any suspicious activity is monitored using AWS Glue and SageMaker.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Alerts**: Triggers users through Amazon SNS upon immediate detection of the threats.
- ???? **User Feedback Loop**: Retrieves feedback through a user interface and channels them to influence updates of the system.

## Impact
This application can dramatically prevent financial fraud. In addition, it is very likely to instill greater user trust in any digital communication network. This can;
- ????️ Save sensitive communities from all types of frauds and other forms of criminality.
-✍️ Enhances financial security and stability, especially in areas vulnerable to such fraud.
-Safer and more trusted financial environment.

## ???? Innovation

Why it is unique:
- ???? Full-Spectrum Financial Fraud Solution: Solves three sub-problems of financial fraud simultaneously—spam detection, deepfake analysis, and transaction monitoring.
- ⏱️ Real-Time Execution: Offers real-time detection and alert services to limit damage.
- ???? **Scalability and Reliability**: Built on AWS services, ensuring robustness in high-volume environments.
- ???? **Holistic Solution**: Advanced AI technologies combined with machine learning for an all-in-one fraud detection system.

## Architecture
Architecture Diagram
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   • Calls and VKYC session data uploaded to Amazon S3
   • Transaction data ingested via AWS Glue

2. **Processing**:
- AWS Lambda functions scan data for spam detection, deepfake analysis, and fraud detection.
- Amazon SageMaker trains models for facial and voice anomaly detection.
 
3. **Alerts and Feedback**:
   Alerts are sent in case of suspicious activities using Amazon SNS.
   Users provide feedback through a UI built with AWS Amplify.

- Set up S3, Lambda, RDS, Glue, and SageMaker.

### **2. Spam Call Detection**
- Use AWS Transcribe to transcribe call audio.
- Use AWS Comprehend to analyze transcripts for phishing keywords.
- Invoke real-time Lambda functions for metadata analysis.

### **3. Deepfake Detection in VKYC**
- Use Rekognition for facial analysis.
- Train SageMaker models to identify anomalies in facial features and voice patterns.

### **4. Financial Fraud Detection
- Analyze transaction patterns using Glue and SageMaker anomaly detection algorithms.

### **5. Real-Time Alerts**
- Set up Amazon SNS for instant notifications.
- Develop a user interface with AWS Amplify to report and respond to threats.
